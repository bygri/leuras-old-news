We are indebted to Mr. William Eyre for the following intelligence:â€”

SYDNEY, Thursday night.

Great excitement and speculation are occurring over the shale deposits at
Katoomba and Leura. Melbourne speculators are anxious to buy shale land.

Further sales of Leura estate are reported at full rates.

The Railway Department has agreed to issue two months' return tickets from the
far West to the town of Katoomba in order to encourage Western squatters to
visit the Blue Mountain scenery.

The proposed racecourse is looked upon with much interest, and it is believed it
will be well patronised by the Sydney public and sportsmen.
