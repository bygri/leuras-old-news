# Leura, the New Model Township, Katoomba East

THOSE who have not recently visited the Charming LEURA ESTATE cannot understand the extent of the improvements that arc going on there.

The 66ft. Government Road is being cut and formed from Leura Mall to the Gladstone Estate, forming, when finished, a fine drive through the Estate; then, the Proprietor of the Gladstone Estate intends to make the road to that splendid Racecourse of 80 acres, which is intended to be surveyed and formed, then the Road will be continued to that truly magnificent Sight,

**THE DENISON LOOK-OUT,**

Formerly known as James' Look-out. This is, without any exception, the finest view upon the Blue Mountains, far surpassing in grandeur Govett's Leap or Wentworth Falls. Those who entertain any doubt about this had better get the younger Peckman to drive them to see this Sight.

Besides the above, there are other gorges of great beauty, and the

**GLADSTONE PASS** IS WORTH SEEING.

Great improvements are intended for next season, which, when carried out, will make LEURA truly the Model Township on the Blue Mountains.

The owners of the Leura Estate are not in a Rip Van Winkle sleep, as is the case elsewhere, but they are steadily opening up, clearing, and beautifying the Estate, and several knowing residents in Katoomba have quietly invested in Allotments of Land at Leura. One well-known tradesman at Katoomba (who never makes any mistakes in his investments) has, in the quietest possible manner, invested a good round sum. He knows well what he has done, and it requires no prophet to foretell the large profit he will make.

RECOLLECT, WE GO ON IMPROVING LEURA ESTATE EVERY WEEK.

Eight men are now at work, and many more will soon be employed. Mr. Editor, I have opened the eyes of the Residents a trifle; suffice it to say that those who invest in Land at Leura Estate will indeed reap a rich harvest.
