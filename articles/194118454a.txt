Precis: Mention of a Leura Salvation Army Brigade.

#salvation-army-brigade
----
The Leura Brigade held a salvation meeting on Sunday last near Katoomba Falls.
Brother Wax's testimony will never be forgotten.

Why did Fred and Jack break from the ranks when the Leura Brigade were on the
tramp? What a pity the dears would not look at them.
