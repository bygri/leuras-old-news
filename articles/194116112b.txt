# The Lyre Bird.

PERHAPS it is not generally known that Lyre Birds abound NEAR LEURA VALE and
LEURA ESTATE. However, one of these extremely beautiful Lyre Birds was SHOT
EXPRESSLY FOR THE UNDERSIGNED, and is now being stuffed by those well-known
Taxidermists, Messrs. Tost and Kohn, of Sydney, after which it is extremely
likely that it will be presented to His Excellency LORD CARRINGTON, Who with
LADY CARRINGTON, takes so great an interest in the lovely Katoomba District.

WILLIAM EYRE, 112 King-street, Sydney.
