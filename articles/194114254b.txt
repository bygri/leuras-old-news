"Land is the source of all wealth"

# The New Model Township of Leura, Katoomba East.

THE rapid rise in the value of Land at Katoomba was clearly shown on Friday
last, 3rd May, when a 66 feet allotment of Land, fronting Cascade and Parkes
Streets, realised the large price of £490 cash, at Messrs. Richardson and
Wrench's auction sale.

It is true there was a very small Galvanised Iron Store on the Land, the value
of which was under £30, so that, deducting this sum, it still leaves £460 cash,
realised as the value of this small allotment of 1 rood 84 perches, equal to £7
per foot frontage, thus proving that land in the Township of Katoomba is in
great request, and is actually fetching more than many of the Suburban
Townships of Sydney.

Buyers in the Leura Estate may fairly expect to realise similar large profits
on their purchases, and the undersigned can recommend it as one of the best
investments in the colony.

You are requested to visit the Leura Estate and judge of the many advantages it
offers.

William Eyre, Midas Chambers, 112 King-street, Sydney.
