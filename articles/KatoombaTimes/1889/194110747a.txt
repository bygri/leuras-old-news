# The Wealthy Squatters From the Far West

They consider the proposal of the **KATOOMBA RACING CLUB** to form a Racecourse
as **One of the Happiest Ideas**, in fact, at DUBBO, amongst a COTERIE OF
SQUATTERS, one Gentleman ACTUALLY RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH DELIGHT, and remarked
that it was **A TRUMP CARD!** and he said it would **Lift Katoomba Right up**,
in importance, a long way **Ahead of the Other Mountain Towns**.

Another Squatter remarked: "He found Katoomba too awful for him after the first
two days; but, if you have **MONTHLY RACE MEETINGS From December to April**,
why," he said, "the WESTERN SPORTSMEN WILL COME DOWN IN SHOALS."

The only difficulty that this Squatter saw was that there would **Not be Half
the Hotel Accommodation for the Visitors.**

But I reminded this Gentleman of the proposed **BURLINGTON PALACE HOTEL**.

"This," he said, "would help to supply the demand."

And it was canvassed in the hotel as to how many the Carrington Hotel would
hold. I remarked that Mr. Goyder might accommodate 200 comfortably. And say 150
up to 200 Visitors might be housed in Katoomba in the other hotels and
boarding-houses. So that if **500 VISITORS ATTENDED** the proposed RACECOURSE
from the Western Districts, and **500 to 1000 Visitors from Sydney**, it follows
clearly what a GREAT IMPETUS will be given to Business in Katoomba, to provide
for this numerous class of Visitors.

It is the opinion of some very shrewd business men that Next Season will be a
Glorious one for Katoomba and Leura.

## Land at Leura

is pretty sure to advance rapidly, and those who have been fortunate in buying
are most likely to resell next season at a **Large Profit**.

Never was a truer statement than **"The Blue Mountains are in Their Infancy."**

But I prophesy that next season will have the effect of **Exterminating all the
Croakers** by the way that **Land Will Rise In Value**.

This is the time for you to BUY LAND AT LEURA ESTATE. Next January will be the
time for you to **Sell at a Good Profit.**
