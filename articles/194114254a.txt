For Clearing and Underscrubbing

NO.4 SECTION, LEURA ESTATE

In all 22 Allotments, about ten acres.

The property of the undersigned, which is selected as the site for the proposed

Burlington Palace Hotel and grounds.

All the ugly TREES will have to be taken out by the roots; nothing to be left
but what is ornamental; the land thoroughly underscrubbed, and
the undergrowth burnt off.

Tenders to be sent in or before the 1st of JUNE, to my office.

William Eyre, 112 King-street, Sydney.
