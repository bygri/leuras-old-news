The following little incident is said to have occurred somewhere on the Blue
Mountains, not at Leura, where a siding and platform are in course of
construction:â€”A [?] visitor inspected the work and said to the men,
"Do you know who I am?" "No," was the reply. "I am the gentleman who is paying
for this." "Oh, are you?" replied one of men; "well, we are the gentlemen what's
doing the job."
