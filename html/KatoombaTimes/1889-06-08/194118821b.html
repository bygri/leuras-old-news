                <h1>Swiss Villas at Leura.</h1>
<p>SEVERAL wealthy squatters are now in treaty with Mr. William Eyre for
ALLOTMENTS of LAND at LEURA ESTATE, with a view of erecting on them those
charming <strong>SWISS VILLAS</strong>, The picturesque appearance of which is so much
admired as being so suitable for LEURA the Gem of the Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>Messrs. Peckman Bros. have been introduced to Thomas Cook and Son, of Cook's
Tourists' Bureau, Sydney, and some important arrangements are likely to be made
for visitors viewing the NEW and TRULY MAGNIFICENT SIGHTS, by <strong>THE DENISON
LOOK-OUT</strong>, Which is unsurpassed for grandeur on the Blue Mountains; the drive
to this gorgeous sight is only 7 to 10 minutes from the LEURA ESTATE. Eight men
are now at work making the road, which will be completed in a month's time, and
ready for Carriage Traffic to the LEURA RACECOURSE of 80 Acres, which, it may be
explained, is a Natural Racecourse; only a few tea-tree scrubs have to be
cleared away to have it formed.</p>
<p><strong>LEURA, the Gem of the Blue Mountains</strong>, is likely to be the <strong>ARISTOCRATIC
TOWNSHIP</strong>, Judging from the many wealthy buyers, such as Bankers, Squatters,
Merchants and Gentlemen of independent means who have purchased allotments at
the Leura Estate.</p>
<p>The WEALTHY SQUATTERS from the far west are fully alive to the importance of
having their cottages at LEURA so that their wives and families can enjoy their
Mountain Retreats in the hot summer months, and so <strong>Keep Themselves in High
Condition</strong>.</p>
<p>The LAND at LEURA is in GREAT DEMAND. Those who buy now are likely to reap a
Large Profit on their purchases.</p>
<p>WILLIAM EYRE, 112 King-street.</p>
