                <h1>The Leura Estate.</h1>
<p>THE NEW RACECOURSE, as selected by the KATOOMBA RACING CLUB, was visited
recently by a distinguished party of Ladies and Gentlemen. Mr. F. C. Goyder, of
the Carrington Hotel, the old and well-known Sportsman, undertook to show the
party round the proposed RACECOURSE, and it was UNANIMOUSLY VOTED to be <strong>The
Most Natural Racecourse</strong> to be found in the colony.</p>
<p>Mr. F. C. Goyder, of the Carrington, was kind enough to say that he would give
his time for a few days in <strong>Marking Out The New Course</strong>, showing the correct
curves, PRIOR to the Surveyor making the FINAL SURVEY, and it is considered
that with the kind assistance and advice of Mr. Goyder that the KATOOMBA RACING
CLUB is likely to prove a <strong>Great Success</strong>.</p>
<p>To old Sportsmen it is needless to mention the names of the following Celebrated
Horses, owned by Mr. Goyder in Melbourne, vis.:—Narcisse, Prodigious, Dalesman,
Sussex, Quicksilver, Neotsfield, &amp;c.; all these in their day carried away the
Big Races.</p>
<p>And who shall say that a <strong>Bright and Successful Future</strong> is not in store for
the proposed <strong>LEURA RACECOURSE</strong> of the KATOOMBA RACING CLUB? <strong>The Road</strong> will
be <strong>Finished</strong> from the <strong>Leura Estate</strong> (only a half a mile from the
Racecourse) and will BE READY FOR TRAFFIC IN 14 DAYS. And if all goes well there
is nothing to prevent the KATOOMBA RACING CLUB proving a GREAT SUCCESS.</p>
<p><strong>THE LEURA ESTATE</strong> is <strong>Fast Being Purchased</strong> for Investment, and it is
questionable whether a More Profitable Investment could be found in New South
Wales. Judging from the Large Advances in Price that have taken place elsewhere,
a profit of from 100 to 300 per cent, may fairly be expected in the next one and
a half to three or four years. Already RESALES have been made at 100 per cent.
in the past six or seven months; therefore, as a <strong>Sound Investment</strong> it can
confidently be recommended.</p>
<p><strong>THE DENISON LOOKOUT</strong>, only a half mile from the proposed RACECOURSE, is
indeed a Gorgeous Sight. Nowhere on the Blue Mountains can be seen such a
Panorama of Beauty.</p>
<p>Talk about the description given in the glowing and beautiful language of
Claude Melnotte to Pauline of their future home, in that charming Play, "The
Lady of Lyons"—that sinks into utter insignificance to the EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY
of <strong>THE LEURA ESTATE</strong>.</p>
<p>Only a few days ago a beautiful LYRE BIRD was shot there expressly for the
Undersigned, who is having it stuffed by Tost and Rohn, of William-street,
Sydney, prior to its being exhibited.</p>
<p>Squatters and Landed Proprietors in the Hot Country of the Far West ought
IMMEDIATELY to PURCHASE ALLOTMENTS on the <strong>Leura Estate</strong>, in order to save
themselves and their families from the <strong>Fearful Heat</strong> of the Summer Months—
say after shearing time, from 1st December to April.</p>
<p>The Refreshing Mountain Air will soon Cool their Coppers, and Restore the Action
of the Liver. The question so often asked: <strong>"How is Your Liver?"</strong> will soon
be answered, "Oh, all right; I have just returned fro Leura, Katoomba."</p>
<p>To Squatters from Dubbo, Nyngan, Bourke, Coonamble, Cobar, Nevertire, Warren,
Dandaloo, and the Hot Districts, this is an opportunity of Buying Allotments of
Land at Very Low Prices, which must Largely Advance in Value. A very comfortable
W.B. six-roomed Cottage, fenced in, can be put up for £275 to £300; so that it
is a most economical mode of saving and preserving the health of yourself and
your family.</p>
<p>The Leading Medical Men of Sydney are all building houses for them selves on the
Blue Mountains, and they all assert that the air of Katoomba District is far
preferable to Tasmania, without one quarter the expense incurred by going to
Tasmania.</p>
<p>Therefore, the <strong>Leura Estate</strong> as an investment stands without any superior in
New South Wales; and, as a Sanatorium, with its Gorgeous and Romantic Scenery,
it is all that can be desired. The <strong>Leura Estate</strong> is <strong>Selling Rapidly</strong> to
the Most Respectable Buyers.</p>
<p>For Plans and Prices of the various Lots apply to WILLIAM EYRE, 112 King-street,
Sydney.</p>
<p><strong>Terms Liberal</strong>—25 per cent, Cash. Balance in Promissory Notes to SUIT BUYERS
as per arrangement.</p>
<p>The Railway Department have agreed to issue Return Tickets, covering two months,
from all Railway Stations in the Far West to the Deliciously Cool and Bracing
Climate of Katoomba, so that Squatters in the Far West can leave their Stations
by the train and arrive in 8, 10, or 12 hours at Katoomba, and if they travel by
the Sleeping Car <strong>No Inconvenience</strong> by the trip will be felt.</p>
