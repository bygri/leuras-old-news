                <h1>The Wealthy Squatters From the Far West</h1>
<p>They consider the proposal of the <strong>KATOOMBA RACING CLUB</strong> to form a Racecourse
as <strong>One of the Happiest Ideas</strong>, in fact, at DUBBO, amongst a COTERIE OF
SQUATTERS, one Gentleman ACTUALLY RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH DELIGHT, and remarked
that it was <strong>A TRUMP CARD!</strong> and he said it would <strong>Lift Katoomba Right up</strong>,
in importance, a long way <strong>Ahead of the Other Mountain Towns</strong>.</p>
<p>Another Squatter remarked: "He found Katoomba too awful for him after the first
two days; but, if you have <strong>MONTHLY RACE MEETINGS From December to April</strong>,
why," he said, "the WESTERN SPORTSMEN WILL COME DOWN IN SHOALS."</p>
<p>The only difficulty that this Squatter saw was that there would <strong>Not be Half
the Hotel Accommodation for the Visitors.</strong></p>
<p>But I reminded this Gentleman of the proposed <strong>BURLINGTON PALACE HOTEL</strong>.</p>
<p>"This," he said, "would help to supply the demand."</p>
<p>And it was canvassed in the hotel as to how many the Carrington Hotel would
hold. I remarked that Mr. Goyder might accommodate 200 comfortably. And say 150
up to 200 Visitors might be housed in Katoomba in the other hotels and
boarding-houses. So that if <strong>500 VISITORS ATTENDED</strong> the proposed RACECOURSE
from the Western Districts, and <strong>500 to 1000 Visitors from Sydney</strong>, it follows
clearly what a GREAT IMPETUS will be given to Business in Katoomba, to provide
for this numerous class of Visitors.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of some very shrewd business men that Next Season will be a
Glorious one for Katoomba and Leura.</p>
<h2>Land at Leura</h2>
<p>is pretty sure to advance rapidly, and those who have been fortunate in buying
are most likely to resell next season at a <strong>Large Profit</strong>.</p>
<p>Never was a truer statement than <strong>"The Blue Mountains are in Their Infancy."</strong></p>
<p>But I prophesy that next season will have the effect of <strong>Exterminating all the
Croakers</strong> by the way that <strong>Land Will Rise In Value</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the time for you to BUY LAND AT LEURA ESTATE. Next January will be the
time for you to <strong>Sell at a Good Profit.</strong></p>
