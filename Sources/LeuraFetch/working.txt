HERE IS THE WORKING METHOD

IF DOING AN ISSUE

1) receive an Issue id
  - fetch HEAD and see where I am relocated to. That's my first page.

2) fetch PAGE url
  - get the 'startingUri' for the Browse service
  - from this we can get the issue JSON url for the Browse service

3) fetch ISSUE JSON url
  - parse pages from it and then run the page fetch routine for each

IF DOING A PAGE

1) fetch PAGE url
  - get the 'startingUri' for the Browse service
  - from this we can get the article JSON url for the Browse service

2) fetch ARTICLE json url
  - parse the articles from it

3) fetch IMAGE data url
  - find out the image bounds

4) fetch all TILES
  - stitch them together



We have an ISSUE link like this:
  http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/issue/1881662

curl -i http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/issue/1881662
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Location: http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/issue/1881662

It will 302 redirect us to a PAGE like this:
  http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/21704646

The page HTML gives us this line:
  startingUri = "ndp:browse/title/K/title/906/189/1890/05/31/page/21704647";
  which actually means
  http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/browse?uri=ndp:browse/title/K/title/906/189/1890/05/31/page/21704647
  which provides us with a JSON listing of all articles in the page

or THIS:
  http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/browse?uri=ndp:browse/title/K/title/906/189/1890/05/31
  giving us all pages in the issue



image info is loaded from:
  http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/image/info/21704646
which gives us the following XML:
  <image>
    <prefix>tile-</prefix>
    <extension>jpg</extension>
    <width>4739</width>
    <height>6243</height>
    <tilesize>256</tilesize>
    <blanktile>tile-blank.jpg</blanktile>
    <thumb>thumb.jpg</thumb>
    <print>page.pdf</print>
    <maxlevel>
      <col>7</col>
      <row>7</row>
    </maxlevel>
    <levels>
      ...
      <level id='6'>
        <colmin>1</colmin>
        <colmax>14</colmax>
        <rowmin>0</rowmin>
        <rowmax>15</rowmax>
        <width>3080</width>
        <height>4058</height>
        <xoffset>508</xoffset>
        <yoffset>19</yoffset>
        <scale>0.65</scale>
      </level>
      ...
    </levels>
  </image>


This is the tile URL format:
  http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/imageservice/nla.news-page21704646/tile6-1-0
  that is tile[ZOOM]-[X]-[Y]
  with x and y being measured from the top-left. There is also an offset!
